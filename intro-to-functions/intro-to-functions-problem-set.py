# You are writing a function named relocate_plant, which will take one plant and a proposed new spot for it, and move the plant there. Which one of these is the best set of parameters?

# Answer: relocate_plant(plant, location)

# Syntax - id: v6k6kC
# Given this code...identify this piece of syntax: def maintain_plant(plant):

# def maintain_plant(plant):
#     if needs_water(plant):
#         water(plant)
#     if needs_sunlight(plant):
#         new_location = find_available_sunny_spot(plant)
#         relocate(plant, new_location)
