# Example: Dining Out
# Follow these steps for each example:
options = ["the place I'm craving but is too far away",
           "the place we always go to",
           "that place that just opened but looks too fancy"
           ]
for option in options:
    print(f"What about getting food from {option} tonight?")

# Read through the code and identify:
# What is the list?
# What is each element?
# What do we name each element?
# How do we use each element in the loop?
# Predict what will print
# Run the code and check your prediction
